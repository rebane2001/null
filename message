DELETE THE ARCHIVES / DESTROY ALL EVIDENCE / LEAVE NO TRACE
FORGET WHAT YOU CAN / REPRESS WHAT YOU NEED / REMEMBER IF YOU MUST / BUT NEVER SPEAK OF IT
DENY EVERYTHING
TURN YOUR BACK ON THEM / CUT ALL TIES / GIVE NO WARNINGS / SAY NO GOODBYES
BE IN THE SILENCE / BE STILL
DO NOT BE AFRAID / TO HAVE NOTHING / TO BE NOBODY
DO NOT BE AFRAID TO BE ALONE
FROM THE EMPTINESS / SOMETHING NEW
Where did you go that summer afternoon? Been meaning to ask you...
Do you think there's really a place like that?
Question Mark
null
Love what you'll never see twice
Destiny is strange, isn't it?
Plucking strings and broken wings
